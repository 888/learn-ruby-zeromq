# Learn ZeroMQ by example! #

## Getting Started ##

**This is currently a work in progress**

Getting started may require a ruby env a bit different from what you're running. The two gems you need ffi, and ffi-rzmq probably should be build from HEAD, not their last official release.

1. Get a functioning ruby, either jruby (recommended) or 1.9.2. I recommend using rvm to manage multiple rubies
2. If you're using jruby 'gem install ffi' will work fine. **If using 1.9.2 you MUST install the special ffi gem** included here, or build it from HEAD yourself.
2. Install the ffi-rzmq gem included in this repo's gems dir, or build it straight from HEAD yourself.
3. You're set! Follow the numbered examples in order.
