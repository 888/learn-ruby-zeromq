## About ZeroMQ ##

ZeroMQ is one of the most exciting technologies emerging today. Follow along with these tutorials explaining the usage of the ffi-rzmq gem.

Be sure to follow them in order, as concepts shown in earlier chapters won't be described later on.

## Getting Started ##


1. Get a functioning ruby, either jruby (recommended) or 1.9.2. I recommend using rvm to manage multiple rubies
2. If you're using jruby `gem install ffi` will work fine. **If using 1.9.2 you MUST install the special ffi gem** included here, or build it from HEAD yourself.
2. Install the ffi-rzmq gem included in this repo's gems dir, or build it straight from HEAD yourself.
3. You're set! Follow the numbered examples in order.
